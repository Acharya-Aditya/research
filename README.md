# ToDo
1. Construct custom gillespie class (with system-dependent & system-independent propensities) for SSA (array based onputs (multiple reactants & products))
2. Monte Carlo simulation of exit paths in Maier-Stein system
3. Transition path gaussian noise sampling algorithm in paper (Need to?)
3. Optimization using gillespie
